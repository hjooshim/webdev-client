                This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with
                vertical spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore
                vertical white spaces and render all the text as one single set of
                sentences. To force the browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the
                paragraphs you want to separate with the paragraph tag
            </p>
            <p id="wd-p-2">
                This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
                vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
            </p>
            <p id="wd-p-3">
                This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
                gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default
                browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on
                the right.
            </p>
            <p id="wd-p-4">
                This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph
                tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.

            <p id="wd-ai-p">
                The paragraph tag is a block element, so browsers give it a default
                margin above and below. That margin creates the vertical gap between
                paragraphs, even though whitespace in the source is ignored.
