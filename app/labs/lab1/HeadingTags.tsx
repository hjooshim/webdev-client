        <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
        Text documents are often broken up into several sections and subsections.
        Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or heading that
        attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes. For instance
        this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The font of the
        section headings are usually larger and bolder than their subsection
        headings. This document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML
        Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags can be used
        to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as large headings.
        There are 6 heading tags for different sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and
        h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading. A{" "}
